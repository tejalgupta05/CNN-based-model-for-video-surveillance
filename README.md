# CNN-based-model-for-video-surveillance
We usually prefer CNN over any other neural network for image processing as it has the reduced number of units in the network, which means fewer parameters to learn and reduced chance of overfitting. All the layers of a CNN have multiple convolutional filters working and scanning the complete feature matrix and carry out the dimensionality reduction. This enables CNN to be a very apt and fit network for image classifications and processing.
# CNN BASED STRUCTURE 
We have used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detection. A novel CNN structure is proposed based on the characteristics of anomaly detection. The stored images are loaded into memory and the model is designed using tensorflow. The images are pre processed on the run by the library itself and the size is reduced to make the whole training process feasible according to the space. The trained model is saved along with the weights for further use in live video stream detection.
